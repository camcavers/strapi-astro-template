Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (version 18.x or higher)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Git (to clone the repository)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies
a. CMS (Strapi v5)
Navigate to the cms/ directory and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd cms
npm install
b. Frontend (Astro)
Navigate to the frontend/ directory and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Running the Project
1. Start the CMS
In the cms/ directory, start the Strapi server:

bash
Copy code
cd ../cms
npm run develop
This will start the Strapi CMS in development mode. The default URL is http://localhost:1337.

2. Start the Frontend
In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend/ directory and start the Astro development server:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
This will start the Astro frontend application. The default URL is http://localhost:4321.

Configuration
Environment Variables
CMS (Strapi v5)
Strapi uses environment variables for configuration. You can create a .env file in the cms/ directory.

Example .env file:

env
Copy code
HOST=localhost
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=your_app_keys
API_TOKEN_SALT=your_api_token_salt
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your_admin_jwt_secret
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT=your_transfer_token_salt
Replace the placeholders (your_app_keys, your_api_token_salt, etc.) with secure, random strings.

Frontend (Astro)
The frontend application needs to communicate with the CMS. Create a .env file in the frontend/ directory:

env
Copy code
PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=http://localhost:1337
PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your_strapi_api_token
PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL: The URL where your Strapi CMS is running.
PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN: The API token for accessing the Strapi API (see below for instructions on generating this token).
Generating a Strapi API Token
To generate an API token in Strapi:

Start the Strapi server:

bash
Copy code
cd cms
npm run develop
Access the Strapi Admin Panel:

Navigate to http://localhost:1337/admin in your browser.

Create an Admin User:

If this is your first time running Strapi, you'll be prompted to create an admin account.

Generate the API Token:

Go to Settings in the sidebar.
Under Global Settings, click on API Tokens.
Click the Create new API Token button.
Name: Provide a name for your token (e.g., Frontend).
Token Type: Choose Custom.
Permissions: Select the permissions your frontend requires (e.g., find and findOne for your content types).
Click Generate.
Copy the generated token.
Update the Frontend .env File:

Paste the token into your frontend/.env file:

env
Copy code
PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your_generated_api_token
